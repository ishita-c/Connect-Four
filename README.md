# Connect-Four
An implementation of Connect Four using the following languages/libraries/framework/interface: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Bootstrap4, DOM. 

## Objectives of the Project:
* A user should be able to start a new game.
* A user should be presented with a game grid with 6 rows and 7 columns.
* Each game should have two players who have different color game pieces.
* Players should be able to alternate turns placing their game pieces.
* Players should only be able to place game pieces in valid grid slots.
* Whenever a player has won the game, a notification message should appear with the results and a way to start a new game.
* Making a request will give user a new game id and clean grid.

## Game Background
There are several variations of the game, but for this project I've used the basic rules. A gameplay example: the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of their Blue discs into the column of his choice of an empty game board. The two players then take alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until one of the players, achieves a horizantal/vertical/diagonal four, and wins the game. For games where the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the games are a draw.
